## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my DevOps course repository! This repository is dedicated to my journey through learning DevOps, containing projects, assignments, and resources related to the course.

📚 Course Overview

This repository is part of my DevOps course curriculum, where I'm learning key DevOps concepts, including:
1. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
3. Containerization with Docker
4. Orchestration with Kubernetes
5. Monitoring and Logging
   
🛠️ Tools and Technologies

Throughout this course, I’m working with:
1. Docker for containerization
2. Kubernetes for orchestration
3. Jenkins/GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines
4. Terraform for infrastructure management
5. Ansible for automation and configuration management

📝 Blog Summaries
1. Kyverno: The Rising Standard for Policy Management
This blog introduces Kyverno as a Kubernetes-native policy management tool, highlighting its role in simplifying policy enforcement across clusters. Kyverno’s policy-as-code approach enables users to define, validate, and audit policies using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Unlike other policy engines, Kyverno is tailored for Kubernetes, making it easy to integrate without additional language learning. It covers core features like validating resource configurations, mutating resources, and generating default settings, establishing Kyverno as a powerful tool for maintaining security and compliance in Kubernetes environments.

2. Managing High-Traffic Websites with Kubernetes
This blog explores how Kubernetes enhances scalability and reliability for high-traffic websites. It explains how Kubernetes orchestrates containerized applications across clusters to handle spikes in demand seamlessly. Key components, such as horizontal pod autoscaling and load balancing, help manage traffic surges by automatically adjusting resources. The blog also discusses Kubernetes' self-healing and monitoring capabilities, making it a robust solution for high-traffic website management and providing a more resilient infrastructure.
